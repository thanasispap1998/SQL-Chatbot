# SQL-Chatbot

This project aims to recreate SQL in a more step-by-step process for the user. The user answers questions from a chatbot and step by step completes the SQL query that will be executed inside the MySQL Workbench. (co-authored by Fivos Tzavellos)

First of all, all files mentioned below, except the report of course, must be placed in the same folder for the notebooks to properly work. In the GitHub repository they are separated in different folders only for the purposes of clarification and order.

This GitHub repository contains all the Jupyter Notebooks and any additional necessary files for this project to work. More specifically it contains:

1) a folder named "Notebooks" containing the "Functions" and "ChatBot" notebooks

2) a folder named "Datasets" containing the two datasets used for both notebooks

3) a folder named "Report" containing the report of this project

Here is a quick summary of the notebooks:

1) Functions: This notebook contains all the functions that are called in the "ChatBot" notebook in order to execute certain SQL queries.

2) ChatBot: The "ChaBot" notebook is essentially the whole project. The chatbot guides to user throughout the whole query step by step. First, we connect to the Workbench and after that the user is free to choose any action he wants to perform, from creating a new database to executing an "Insert" query.

And here is a quick summary of the datasets:

1) Both datasets are just random data about NBA players used to fill the database for experimentation purposes.

Feel free to experiment with any algorithm, any process or even use totally different datasets from what I used!
