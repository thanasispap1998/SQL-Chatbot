In this case the user MUST input the condition he wants but instead of typing all the nested select he should only type \"()\" (without the quotations). After moving to the next step, he will be asked to fill every nested select one by one in the previous condition and only when he finishes them all will he move to the next condition.\n",

    "\n",
    "Every condition that does not allow nested select queries does not make this extra step of looking for \"()\" but only the ones mentioned before. In case no \"()\" is found in the input, the procedure continues normally like any other action/condition.\n",
